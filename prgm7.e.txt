Step 1: Create an Inventory File
1. Open your text editor to create a file called hosts.ini:
2. nano hosts.ini
3. Add the following content to define the local host:
 [local]
 localhost ansible_connection=local
 Explanation:
▪ [local] is a group name.
▪ localhost is the target host.
▪ ansible_connection=local tells Ansible to execute commands on the
local machine without SSH.

6. Save the file by pressing Ctrl+O then Enter, and exit with Ctrl+X.

Step 2: Create the Playbook File
1. Open your text editor to create a file called setup.yml:
2. nano setup.yml


- name: Basic Server Setup
  hosts: local
  become: true  # Optional: if your tasks need root access
  tasks:
    - name: Example task
      debug:
        msg: "Hello, this is a basic setup"

Step 3: Execute the Playbook
In your terminal, run the following command:
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini setup.yml

ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini setup.yml --ask-become-pass
