Experiment 9: Introduction to Azure DevOps: Overview of Azure DevOps
Services, Setting Up an Azure DevOps Account and Project
Overview of Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps is a comprehensive suite of cloud-based services designed to support the entire
software development lifecycle. It provides tools for planning, developing, testing, delivering,
and monitoring applications. Here are the primary services offered:
• Azure Repos:
A set of version control tools that allow you to host Git repositories or use Team
Foundation Version Control (TFVC). It offers collaboration features such as pull
requests, branch policies, and code reviews.
• Azure Pipelines:
A CI/CD service that helps automate builds, tests, and deployments. It supports multiple
languages, platforms, and can run on Linux, Windows, or macOS agents.
• Azure Boards:
A work tracking system that helps teams manage work items, sprints, backlogs, and
Kanban boards. It facilitates agile planning and reporting.
• Azure Test Plans:
Provides a solution for managing and executing tests, capturing data about defects, and
tracking quality.
• Azure Artifacts:
Allows you to create, host, and share packages (such as Maven, npm, NuGet, and
Python packages) with your team, integrating package management into your CI/CD
pipelines.
These services integrate with each other and with popular third-party tools to create a cohesive
DevOps ecosystem.
